# Dapp blockchain based rewards system with Ethereum

This is a Dapp (decentralized application) sample implementation of a rewards system using blockchain and ethereum network, available for studying. 

The frontend applicatin was forked and adapted using the repository [e-shop](https://github.com/james-muriithi/e-shop).

## Features

- Metamask integration using web3.js
- Creates a fake cryptocurrency, using symbol CEM (refers to my last name "Cembranelli"), following [ERC-20](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) token standard
- Allows user to reedem products based on his wallet account balance
- Allows administrator to issue tokens (coins) to the users
## Stack

- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/): This comes with a development environment, a testing framework, and a development blockchain.
- Solidity: used to develop the smart contracts.
- [Web3.js](): A library for interacting with metamask and deployed smart contracts on the frontend.
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache): A development blockchain for deploying smart contracts and inspecting state during development,
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A framework for building user interfaces.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): A wallet for user private keys management.

## Architecture Overview

![arch](/doc/arch.png)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

> Install

To be able to run this app, youâ€™ll need to have:

- Node.js.
- Truffle.
- Ganache development blockchain.
- Metamask chrome extension.

Note that we wonâ€™t need real Ether tokens as we will be using test Ether tokens from our development blockchain (Ganache).

> Before you run the application

- Start your Ganache blockchain

![ganache](/doc/ganache.png)

- Deploy the smart contract

Go to the root folder and run:

``truffle migrate``

This contract will create the cryptocurrency (CEM) with an initial total supply of 1 milion. It will then transfer this amount to the administrator account.

The contract will also issue tokens (100 CEM) to the first 2 users (accounts) on the Ganache blockchain. The users then can use the tokens to reedem products.

- Setup the administrator account

Update the app administrator account on the file src/data/defaultAccountConfig.js, using the first Ganache account:

```
export const config = 
    {
        adminAccount: "[put here your admin account]"
    }
```

The administrator account will be responsible for issuing tokens to the users redeem the products. 

> How setup the users

Update the user accounts on the file src/contracts/issue-token.js with the 2 first accounts on the Ganache:

```
const account_1_address = "[put here your ganache account[1] ]"
const account_2_address = "[put here your ganache account[2] ]"
```

> How to run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/felipecembranelli/blockchain-rewards.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

> Then in your browser go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)


> How to issue more tokens

Run the following script. It is simulating the token issues that could be done automatically in a pre-defined period of time (ex: monthly):

``truffle exec ./scripts/issue-token.js``
